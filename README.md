## TFL Travel Dashboard

quick intro?

### Overall design

design choices, less is more, chartjunk, bootstrap etc

### Visualisation design

#### Visualisation 1: Travel Mode usage Over Time
##### Target audience: 
* TFL Associated Employee: As the manager responsible for hiring bus drivers for TfL (TfL Associated Employee), I want 
to know when in the year bus usage is the lowest so that I can reduce the number of new hires in these periods. [User 
story 03]
##### Question answered: 
* How does usage of TFL services vary over a chosen time period?
##### Data needed:
* TFL usage data for all time periods and all travel modes.
##### Type of chart: 
* Line graph
##### Visual design aspects:
* Colour coded lines to distinguish between travel modes.
* Title describing what aspect of the data is being visualised, in this case travel mode usage over time.
* Subtitle indicating what time periods are currently displayed on the figure.
* The gradient of the lines gives a clear visual indication of the rate at which usage changes 
for each travel mode over time and how overall usage varies between each travel mode.
* The data set contains 12 years of TFL usage data and displaying this all at once could obscure important aspects of
the data as yearly trends would be harder to recognise. The choice choose how many years of data can be displayed at a 
time allows the data to be viewed in more detail by the user. 
* The minimum time period that can be displayed is 1 year. This is as this is it displays the yearly variation in usage, 
an important aspect to consider when making a judgement based on TFL usage.
* There are no additional chart elements shown beyond the title, years displayed, axis labels and key. This keeps the
focus on the actual data and not unnecessary chartjunk.
##### Evaluation 
##### Did it meet the design choices?
##### Strengths and weaknesses?
##### Any improvements?

#### Visualisation 2: [Stats Chart Title]
##### Target audience:
* TFL Associated Employee: As a licenced TfL busker (TfL Associated Employee), I want to know when in the year the usage 
of London Underground peaks so that I can apply for performance slots that will expose me to the highest number of 
people. [User story 02]

#### Visualisation 3: Variation in Travel Modes
##### Target audience:
* TFL Associated Employee: As a TFL Associated Employee I would like to know how much the usage of each travel mode 
varies over a chosen time period so that I can decide how the distribution of emplyees will likely need to be adjusted 
over that time period according how much the number of journeys varies. [New user story]
##### Question answered:
* How much variation is there in TFL usage for each travel mode over a chosen time period.
##### Data needed:
* TFL usage data for all time periods and all travel modes.
##### Type of chart:
* Box-whisker chart
##### Visual design aspects:
* Colour coded lines to distinguish between travel modes.
* Title describing what aspect of the data is being visualised, in this case variation in TFL usage over a certain time 
period for each travel mode.
* Subtitle indicating what time periods are currently displayed on the figure.
* Width of boxes gives a clear visual display of the comparative degree of variation for each travel mode without the 
need for the use of numbers.
* The data set contains 12 years of TFL usage data and displaying this all at once could obscure important aspects of
the data as yearly trends would be harder to recognise. The choice choose how many years of data can be displayed at a 
time allows the data to be viewed in more detail by the user. 
* The minimum time period that can be displayed is 1 year. This is as this is it displays the yearly variation in usage, 
an important aspect to consider when making a judgement based on TFL usage.
* There are no additional chart elements shown beyond the title, years displayed, axis labels and key. This keeps the
focus on the actual data and not unnecessary chartjunk.

#### Visualisation 4: Distribution of Travel Modes
##### Target audience:
* TFL Associated Employee: As an TfL Associated Employee, I want to be able to visualise the distribution of users 
across the TfL transport network for a chosen period so that I can appropriately distribute workers across the service 
according to the number of current users. [User story 01]
##### Question answered:
* How is usage of TFL services distributed between each travel mode for a chosen time period?
##### Data needed:
* TFL usage data for all time periods and all travel modes.
##### Type of chart:
* Pie chart
##### Visual design aspects:
* Colour coded lines to distinguish between travel modes.
* Title describing what aspect of the data is being visualised, in this case the proportion each travel mode takes of
the total TFL usage.
* Subtitle indicating what time periods are currently displayed on the figure.
* The comparative areas of each travel mode and the displayed percentages clearly show the proportion of each travel 
mode.
* The data set contains 12 years of TFL usage data and displaying this all at once could obscure important aspects of
the data as yearly trends would be harder to recognise. The choice choose how many years of data can be displayed at a 
time allows the data to be viewed in more detail by the user. 
* The minimum time period that can be displayed is 1 year. This is as this is it displays the yearly variation in usage, 
an important aspect to consider when making a judgement based on TFL usage.
